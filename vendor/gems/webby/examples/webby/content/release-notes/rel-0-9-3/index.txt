FIXME

Release 0.9.3 adds several new features and fixes a few bugs. The two most significant features are a "wikiwords" filter and a special webby gem for the windows platform. See below for more information.

* 4 minor enhancements
** Added a "wikiwords" filter to process [[text]] as links to other pages (thanks to Paul)
** Added colorization to the output text (facets gem required)
** Replaced the Heel webserver with webrick
** Special windows version with windows line endings in generated files
* 2 bug fixes
** Fixed a bug on Windows where line endings were messing with meta-data
** The paginator was not linking correctly back to the first page from subsequent pages in a list

h3. Wiki Words

Wiki Words provide a convenient way to link to other pages in a site based on the page titles. Page titles surrounded by double brackets will be converted into a link to that particular page.

<pre>
<%= Webby::YAML_SEP %> 
title:      Special Report
created_at: 2008-10-08 21:22:41.217238 -06:00
filter:
  - wikiwords
  - textile
<%= Webby::YAML_SEP %> 
h1. Special Report

This page is a special report that links to some [[Other Page]] in the site and
offers a little more information. You can find out more in the [[Reference]]
page, too.
</pre>

So, in the example above two links will be generated. One will link to the "Other Page" and the second will link to the "Reference" page.

h3. Windows Support

This release also fixes a few issues with webby on the windows platform. Both issues concern windows line endings versus UNIX line endings in files. The code that parses meta-data has been updated to be line ending agnostic -- so no need to use UNIX line endings in the windows world.

The second issue is a windows specific version of the webby gem. This gem has the template site files converted to the windows line ending style. So when a site is created using the webby-gen command, the resulting files should be in the native windows format.
