Below are links to the release notes for the various version of Webby that have been officially released. Please note the humorous release names; these were created at great expense by a team of comedy writers hand picked by Stephen Colbert.

<% @pages.find(:all,
   :sort_by => 'title',
   :reverse => true,
   :in_directory => @page.directory,
   :recursive => true).each do |page|
   next if page == @page
-%>
* *<%= link_to_page page %>*  %(quiet)-- <%= h(page.release_name) %>%
<% end -%>
