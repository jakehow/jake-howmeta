h3. Requirements

Webby is written in the Ruby programming language. To install and run Webby you will need the following applications installed on your system:

* "Ruby":http://ruby-lang.org
* "RubyGems":http://rubygems.org/read/chapter/3

h3(#pages). Pages

Pages are found in the _content_ folder along with regular files. Pages contain *meta-data* at the top of the file; this is what differentiates a page from a regular file. The meta-data is a section of "YAML":http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.1/ formatted text that describes various properties and attributes of the page. These attributes are used by Webby to determine how the page will be processed by the filter engine.

Let's look at an example page.
