This is actually several applications working together ( out of which the "multi_app_routing rails plugin":http://github.com/jakehow/multi_app_routing was born).  The applications provide core functionality for "Sunshine Realty Management":http://sunshineny.com, including but not limited to network monitoring and provisioning, a work order support system, community profiles, service management, and billing.
