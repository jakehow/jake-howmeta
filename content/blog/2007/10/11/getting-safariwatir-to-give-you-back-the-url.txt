Safariwatir is an (incomplete) implementation of Watir except that, you guessed it: it drives Apple's Safari browser rather than IE.  It is missing a decent chunk of functionality from its IE counterpart,  but one thing that was particularly irking me in some integration tests was the inability to get the current URL back.

Throw this in your test_helper or spec_helper

Not bad at all...
